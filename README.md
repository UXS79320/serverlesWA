1. Defined Architecture:
Frontend:
Static Website Hosting: Utilized Amazon S3 to host static web content, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Content Delivery: Optionally employed Amazon CloudFront for global content delivery and distribution of static assets.
Backend:
Compute: Leveraged AWS Lambda for serverless compute.
API Gateway: Created RESTful or GraphQL APIs using Amazon API Gateway.
Data Storage: Selected a database service, such as Amazon DynamoDB for NoSQL or Amazon RDS for SQL.
Authentication and Authorization:
Cognito: Implemented Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization.
Deployment:
Code Deployment: Used AWS CodePipeline or AWS CodeBuild to automate the deployment pipeline.
2. Set Up Frontend:
S3 for Static Content:
Created an S3 bucket for hosting static website content.
Uploaded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
CloudFront (Optional):
Set up a CloudFront distribution for global content delivery.
3. Set Up Backend:
AWS Lambda:
Created Lambda functions for backend logic.
Defined IAM roles for Lambda functions with necessary permissions.
API Gateway:
Established APIs using Amazon API Gateway.
Connected APIs to Lambda functions.
Configured authentication and authorization.
Data Storage:
DynamoDB:

Created a DynamoDB table for data.
Defined necessary indexes.
RDS:
Created an RDS instance for relational database needs.
Configured security groups and IAM roles.
4. Authentication and Authorization:
Amazon Cognito:
Set up a Cognito User Pool for user management.
Integrated Cognito User Pool with API Gateway for authentication.
5. Deployment:
AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild:
Configured a CodePipeline or CodeBuild for continuous integration and deployment.
Managed source, build, and deploy stages.

6. Monitoring and Logging:
Used Amazon CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.
Set up CloudWatch Alarms for critical metrics.
Utilized AWS X-Ray for tracing and debugging.

7. Testing:
Implemented unit testing and integration testing for Lambda functions.
Utilized tools like AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model) for local testing.

8. Additional Considerations:
Serverless Framework: Considered using the Serverless Framework for simplifying deployment and management.
Security: Implemented best practices for securing the serverless application.
Scalability: Ensured the application could scale horizontally with increasing load.

9. Costs:
Understood the cost implications of each service and optimized accordingly.

10. Domain Configuration:
Configured a custom domain using Route 53 if needed.

Throughout the development and deployment process, AWS best practices for security, scalability, and cost optimization were followed.
